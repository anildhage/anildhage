# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a python developer. I write code, define logic, debug issues, test web applications, develop platforms and applications, deploy apps on servers, build websites to suit businesses, organisations and users needs.

<!-- Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
